# scGEAToolbox - a Matlab toolbox for single-cell RNA-seq data analyses

Fig. 1. A software workflow built with scGEAToolbox for single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN) analyses. High-dimensional scRNA-seq data is filtered, normal-ized, and used as input for two paths. The first is a combination of (A) dimension-ality reduction and (B) trajectory/psedotime analysis to provide pseudotime-series data. The second is using network inference algorithms to generate (C) a global, coarse GRN structure. The integration of results from the two paths produces (D) pseudotime-series scGRNs, which can be further analyzed through regulatory modeling using parameter estimation algorithms to infer (E) a refined dynamic scGRN.

(a) Two example panels of the main GUI scGEApp; (b) A 3-D scatter plot showing genes whose position is determined by Âµ, CV and rdrop; (c) A stem plot showing expression level of 50 selected genes across 2000 cells: 1000 in one state (blue) and the other 1000 in the other state (red).
